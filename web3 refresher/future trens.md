 Current State Description
Web3, as an important development stage of blockchain technology, represents the concepts of decentralization, permissionlessness, and distributed networks. Web3 is currently in an evolving and improving stage, facing challenges related to technological maturity, user experience, security, and legal and regulatory uncertainties. For example, within Ethereum, transactions take a long time, fees are expensive, and frequent hacker attacks occur due to smart contract vulnerabilities. As technology continues to innovate and regulatory frameworks are established, these issues are expected to be progressively resolved.

Looking at different ecosystems, the Bitcoin ecosystem, as the earliest implementation of blockchain, is widely recognized for its stability and security. However, due to its relatively limited functionality, it may increasingly serve as a store of value in the future. The Ethereum ecosystem is evolving to address scalability and speed issues. The Polkadot ecosystem offers a multi-blockchain platform and is anticipated to play a pivotal role in the future Web3 ecosystem. The Cosmos ecosystem also focuses on interoperability, providing the foundation for building interconnected blockchain networks. The Solana ecosystem offers a good user experience and could occupy a place in the Web3 field if it continues to provide stable services.


Proof of Work (PoW) has been criticized for its high energy consumption, while the more environmentally friendly Proof of Stake (PoS) has gained favor. Beyond these, the Web3 ecosystem has given rise to various other consensus mechanisms aimed at delivering more efficient and secure networks. With the advancement of technology, we can expect the emergence of even more consensus mechanisms to meet the growing demands of blockchain applications.

Globally, many cities are actively promoting the construction of Web3 ecosystems, with typical examples including Silicon Valley, Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, and Berlin. They attract blockchain startups and projects by implementing blockchain-friendly policies and offering favorable conditions. Singapore and Hong Kong, as international financial centers, are actively laying out frameworks for digital asset exchanges and cryptocurrency-related laws, and are expected to continue to be hotspots for Web3 innovation and investment.


From the Artificial Intelligence Perspective
The development of AI brings new possibilities to Web3, and their combination is expected to give birth to many innovations, such as optimizing the performance of blockchain networks with AI algorithms, enhancing the automation capabilities of smart contracts, and implementing more complex trading strategies in decentralized finance (DeFi). With the integration of AI technology, we can expect to see more personalized digital assistants, smarter asset management tools, and more accurate and effective data analysis and market forecasting models in the future.

Additionally, the approval of a BTC spot ETF in the United States marks a milestone in cryptocurrency history, signifying the formal entry of Bitcoin investment into the mainstream financial market. This will increase Bitcoin’s liquidity, raise its recognition, and may lay the groundwork for ETFs of other cryptocurrencies. For the Web3 ecosystem, this could lead to more capital inflows and attention from ordinary investors.



Proof of History (PoH): PoH aims to create a trustable record of time to verify the sequence and timing of events, allowing network participants to validate that the occurrence of events in order without needing to communicate with each other.
●
Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT): It is designed to tolerate a certain proportion of malicious nodes within the system, ensuring that consensus can be reached network-wide. PBFT is particularly suitable for private or consortium blockchains.
●
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): This is an enhanced version of PoS where users delegate their voting rights to a small number of representatives who are responsible for validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain. DPoS aims to improve network scalability and transaction speed.
●
Proof of Authority (PoA): In PoA, the validation of transactions and blocks is done by pre-selected, trusted nodes (validators). These nodes often take on accountability due to their public identity and are suitable for networks that require speed and efficiency.
●
Pure Proof of Stake (Pure PoS): PPoS eliminates potential centralization issues in PoS by randomly selecting validators to ensure the network’s decentralization and security.
●
Proof of Space (PoSpace) or Proof of Capacity (PoC): These algorithms select block producers based on the amount of storage space provided by network participants. Their advantage is lower energy consumption.
●
Proof of Authentication (PoAuth): Similar to PoA, but PoAuth requires validators to have a public identity, and they are usually trusted individuals or companies chosen by the community.
