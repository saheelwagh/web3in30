The Value of DeFi
Compared to traditional centralized finance (CeFi), decentralized finance offers significant advantages in accessibility, transparency, security, efficiency, innovation, and decentralization.
●
First, DeFi provides borderless financial services, ensuring that users around the globe can transact without geographical limitations as long as they have an internet connection. This is particularly important for regions where traditional banking services are inadequate or unavailable.
●
Second, DeFi utilizes blockchain technology to record all transactions publicly, allowing anyone to verify and audit these records. This openness greatly enhances the system’s transparency and credibility, enabling users to see the flow of funds clearly, which reduces hidden fees and potential malpractices.
●
In terms of security, DeFi protects users’ funds and transactions with advanced encryption technologies, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and hacking. Automated smart contracts also ensure seamless transaction execution without the need for complex procedures and manual reviews typical of traditional financial institutions, thus increasing operational efficiency.
●
On the innovation front, DeFi’s open development platform attracts developers from around the world, fostering the continual emergence of new financial products and services. This community-driven development model encourages the exchange of ideas and rapid iteration, accelerating technological advancement in the financial sector.
●
Finally, unlike traditional financial institutions that may face downtime risks, DeFi’s distributed structure inherently eliminates single points of control, enhancing the system’s resilience to failures and attacks. Even if some nodes are compromised, the network can still operate continuously, ensuring the continuity and stability of financial services.


A prime example of a DeFi project is Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap utilizes a novel automated market maker (AMM) model instead of the traditional order book system, allowing users to trade different cryptocurrencies without intermediaries.

The trading process is as follows:
●
Step one: Users (liquidity providers) deposit their token pairs into a liquidity pool, for instance, adding a certain amount of ETH-USDT token pairs to provide the necessary liquidity for trades.
●
Step two: When other users want to exchange tokens, like swapping ETH for USDT, they simply send ETH to the exchange, and the smart contract automatically carries out the trade at the current rate before transferring the specified amount of USDT.

The Value of DAOs
Compared to traditional companies, DAOs have significant advantages in terms of transparency, trust requirements, operational efficiency, participatory democracy, and security.
●
Firstly, all decision-making processes and financial transactions within a DAO are publicly recorded on the blockchain, which any external auditor can easily verify, thus enhancing the organization’s transparency.
●
Secondly, interactions between members within a DAO are executed via code, so members only need to trust the smart contract code itself, not like in traditional companies where trust in individual leaders or a centralized team is necessary.
●
Additionally, as smart contracts can automatically execute tasks, this reduces the need for manual processing, eliminates many unnecessary intermediaries, and increases the efficiency of the organization’s operations.
●
Moreover, DAOs allow every token-holding member to participate in decision-making, promoting a more democratic decision process and ensuring that the organization is truly driven by its community members.
●
Finally, the use of blockchain technology enhances the security of DAOs because it relies on encryption and consensus algorithms to protect data and assets, thus largely preventing external attacks and internal misuse.
 Typical DAO Projects
Take MakerDAO as an example; it is a decentralized lending platform operating on Ethereum. Users can collateralize crypto assets (like ETH) to generate a stablecoin, DAI. The value of DAI is pegged to the US dollar, aiming to reduce the price volatility risk of cryptocurrencies.The governance structure of MakerDAO is a typical DAO model. Users holding MKR tokens have the right to participate in the governance of the Maker system, including adjusting the issuance policy of the stablecoin DAI, types of collateral, risk parameters, etc. These decisions are made through a public and transparent voting process.
